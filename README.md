# Inventory Management Application

### This is a part of my final group project in CST8288 Business Programming(COBOL) at Algonquin College. I'm only sharing my part of the project.

#### What it does:
The purpose of the application is to keep the track of the inventory coming in, update the inventory, and generates a report.

The application is consisted of 4 parts: conversion, update, generate reports, and calculation. 

#### Introducing my teammates' work in the project:
First, I'll breifly introduce the parts that were done by my teammates.
The conversion converts incoming inventory sequential file which contains product information and supplier sequntial file which contains supplier information to an indexed file.
The update program updates the inventory file which is converted previously.

#### Introducing my work in the project:
My part was to create the program that generates reports and calculates the product value. The report is consisted of 3 parts: inventory report, audit trail, and re-order repot. The inventory report shows the part number, part name, and stock value. The audit trail record shows the total value, number of record read, and number of record written. The total value is calculated in the calcuation program. The re-order report shows the name, number, and quantity of the product which is short in stock and its supplier name.
